- The hardware file comsists of 8 lines with the details of each functional unit in each line
- The memory file has each line with 2 numbers, address of the memory location and value to be saved there 

What Works:
- All instructions are working fine, and tested with corner cases.
- The program was tested with the user input hardware description and it is working fine. 
- Also, having data in a memory file and reading from the memory is working. 

What Does not Work: Nothing :D
